## Configurations in ./altschool-terraform-mini-project/
### main.tf
- Calls and runs the ec2 module.
- Deploys the ansible playbook on the ec2 instances.
## Apply Configurations
### Instruction
When the configuration is running, immediately the hosted zone has been created,
add the name servers for the hosted zone to your domain provider dashboard to ensure the configuration
runs successfully, the terraform configuration has been set to wait for you to do this, this is needed for the acm certificate to be validated.

If the configuration fails, make sure to add the hosted zone name servers to your domain provider's dashboard and apply
again, that's if you didn't do it when the configuration was running.
### Setup
If aws cli is installed, run 'aws configure' in your terminal and pass in the required details to connect to your iam user account.

in ./ansible/vars/ansible.cfg
```
specify the path to your key pair for the ansible connection
```
set right permissions for private key
```
use command: "chmod 400 <path to key>"
```
in ./modules/ec2/variables.tf
```
specify the path to your key pair in variable "remote_exec" for remote_exec connection
specify the name of the key pair to be used in variable "ec2_instance_key"
```
in ./altschool-terraform-mini-project/
```
run 'terraform init' to install neccessary plugins.
run 'terraform fmt' to format configuration files.
run 'terraform validate' to confirm configuration is valid.
run 'terraform plan' to see changes to be made to infrastructure.
```
### Deploy
```
run 'terraform apply --auto-approve' to apply configurations.
```
